# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course: Project Stage 1
---
This is my work of project stage 1. 
There are two html files corresponding to two web pages. Both of them have been added two css break points at 450px and 1000px, respectively. The responsive UI is designed for mobile(0 ~ 450px), tablet(451 ~ 1000px), and Laptop(>1000px).

To run the project:
    - In the project root directory:
         Python 2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 
         Python 3: python3 -m http.server 8000
